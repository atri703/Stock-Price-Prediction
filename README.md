# Stock-Price-Prediction
Explore stock price forecasting using traditional ARIMA, modern LSTM-based RNN, and FB-Prophet models. The web app showcases their performance for easy access by both technical and non-technical users.

## Overview

This project aims to predict stock prices using a combination of traditional time-series models (ARIMA), modern deep learning techniques (LSTM-based RNN), and Facebook Prophet. The goal is to provide accurate forecasts and create an interactive web application for users to visualize and compare predictions.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Model Prediction:** Utilizes ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet models for comprehensive stock price forecasting.
- **Web Application:** An interactive web app allows users to input parameters, visualize predictions, and compare different models.
- **Data Collection:** Historical stock price data is obtained from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance Python library.
- **Two Dataset Cases:** The project considers both large and small datasets to assess model performance under varying data sizes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, yfinance)
- Web browser

## Usage

Input parameters in the web application.
Visualise historical and predicted stock prices.
Compare predictions from different models.

## Models

### ARIMA Model

Traditional time-series model capturing linear relationships in stock price data.

###LSTM Model

Deep learning model (RNN) capturing complex patterns and dependencies in sequential data.

### Prophet Model

Open-source forecasting tool designed for time-series data, robust in handling seasonality and trends.

## Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using metrics like RMSE, MAPE, and MAE. The results section provides a detailed comparison of the forecasting models.

## Results

The project's results highlight strengths and weaknesses, providing insights into the effectiveness of each forecasting model.

## Learning Points

Key learnings include skills acquired, crucial actions for success, and considerations for future work.
